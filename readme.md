# Web-app-for-MFCC-based-Recurrent-Neural-Network-for-automatic-clinical-depression-recognition

This project a MFCC-based Recurrent Neural Network for automatic clinical depression recognition 
and assessment from speech model deployed as a Web Application. The model is a based on one of the proposed solutions of the paper
[Rejaibi, Emna, Komaty, Ali, Meriaudeau, Fabrice, & Othmani, Morgan-Hiring. (2022). MFCC-based Recurrent Neural Network for Automatic Clinical Depression Recognition and Assessment from Speech. Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, 71, 103107. doi: 10.1016/j.bspc.2021.103107.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354324031_MFCC-based_Recurrent_Neural_Network_for_automatic_clinical_depression_recognition_and_assessment_from_speech/citations)

The pre processing function and the model itself is slightly altered . The Dataset used is the [DIAC-WOZ](https://dcapswoz.ict.usc.edu/) dataset
